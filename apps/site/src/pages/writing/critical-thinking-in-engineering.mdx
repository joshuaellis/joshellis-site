# Critical Thinking in Engineering

<Date>30th July 2024</Date>

The easiest way to explain why critical thinking is so valuable to you, as an
engineer is to consider this scenario:

> You find that a value is nullish in a codebase you didn't originally write.
> But the code doesn't handle nullish values, what's the solution?

The first solution you might think of would be to add a check to see if it's
nullish and handle that. That works for this scenario, but I'd argue you've just
fixed the symptom and not the problem. Subsequentally, you might find the same
bug cropping up in numerous places in the codebase and if you're not the one
fixing the next bug, those dots might not be connected.

You might say "Well I use typescript, so that will save me" but remember,
Typescript doesn't do anything at runtime. So how do you solve this using
critical thinking?

**Start asking why.**

"Why is the value nullish?" is the most obvious one, but in reality, critical
thinking isn't overly complex. It's about asking the most obvious questions to
challenge your assumptions on the given problem. When you start asking the
suggested question, you might end up looking at a function that's called several
layers higher in the codebase noting that this function doesn't handle the edge
case that's happening all too often. Or perhaps the API you're calling is now
returning nullish values that you previously were not expecting.
